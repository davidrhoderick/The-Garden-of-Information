The Garden of Information
=========================

This is my, David Rhoderick's, thesis project for my Computer Art MFA degree at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  This Git repository contains the code, databases, and media for the project.  The project is an "organic data visualization," combining data visualization and a robotically controlled environment to express data into plant growth.
